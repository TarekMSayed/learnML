# How to learn machine learning 
I've had a lot of people ask me how to get started with machine learning and/or deep learning. This is a list of some of the resources that I have either found useful myself or heard people who I trust rave about.  

## General Machine Learning 

**Classes**

* [Coursera's Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is the first introduction to machine learning class that everyone uses. Most self-taught data scientists I know have used this class to study for interviews. 

**Reading**

* [Machine Learning by Chris Bishop]() is a common introductory machine learning textbook. While I know some people who have learned machine learning simply by reading this text, I think that it can be a bit thick if it is your first introduction to machine learning, but is a wonderful reference once you have a better idea of how things fit together.  

* [Machine Learning by Kevin Murphy]() is another common introductor machine learning textbook. This is also a wonderful reference but is a bit hard to read cover to cover. 

**Programming**

* [SciKitLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a Python library for machine learning that also explains many machine learning techniques quite well in its documentation. 

## Deep Learning 

**Classes**

* If you want an intuition for what deep learning is and how it works, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) has a series of YouTube videos that explain this really well! 

    * [Chapter 1 - What is a Neural Network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=aircAruvnKk)
    * [Chapter 2 - How Neural Networks Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w)
    * [Chapter 3 - Back propagation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U)

* If you want to build something that uses deep learning, [Fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) is an online course that will get you using deep learning for practical projects within just a few lessons. 

**Reading**

* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

* [Neural Networks & Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

**Programming**

* [Keras](https://keras.io/)

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

**Visualizations**

* [TensorFlow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.63097&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false)

## Reinforcement Learning 

**Reading**

* [Reinforcement Learning by Sutton & Barto](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning)

## Other Resources
