# How to learn machine learning 
I've had a lot of people ask me how to get started with machine learning and/or deep learning. This is a list of some of the resources that I have either found useful myself or heard people who I trust rave about.  

## General Machine Learning 

**Classes**

* [Coursera's Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is the first introduction to machine learning class that everyone uses. Most self-taught data scientists I know have used this class to study for interviews. 

**Reading**

* [Machine Learning by Chris Bishop]() is a common introductory machine learning textbook. While I know some people who have learned machine learning simply by reading this text, I think that it can be a bit thick if it is your first introduction to machine learning, but is a wonderful reference once you have a better idea of how things fit together.  

* [Machine Learning by Kevin Murphy]() is another common introductor machine learning textbook. This is also a wonderful reference but is a bit hard to read cover to cover. 

**Programming**

* [SciKitLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a Python library for machine learning that also explains many machine learning techniques quite well in its documentation. 

## Deep Learning 

**Classes**

* [Fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) is a great online course that focuses on getting the student using deep learning for practical projects as soon as possible. 

**Reading**

* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

* [Neural Networks & Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

**Programming**

* [Keras]()

* [Tensorflow]()

**Visualizations**

* [TensorFlow Playground]()

## Reinforcement Learning 

**Reading**

* [Reinforcement Learning by Sutton & Barto]()

## Other Resources 

* [Distill.pub]()
